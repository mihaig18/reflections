How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped me because i was able to see only the modifications of the file (only the text parts where i made changes).

i will be more efficient programmer because i will learn to be more organized and i will easily came back to old versions of programs.

pros: - commiting manually gives more flexibilitty
	  - commiting automatically could help me don't loose any line codes

I think GIT allow saving multiple files in one commit because in many applications we deal with multiple corelated files.

git log - shows commits details
git diff commit1 commit2 - show differences betweeen files (green - what was added, red - what was removed)
git clone - clone a repository (collection of versions)

git is very useful and it improves my confidence in changing programs. 
git checkout "id" - return to previous version
