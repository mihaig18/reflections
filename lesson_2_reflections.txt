I need to initialize a repository for git to know what files should follow.

I think staging area offers me the posibility to make some major change in multiple file and add as only one commit in repository.

Commit stye example:

To make sure i use only one commit per logical change, i can veify the changes between actual state of program and stage area (last commit).

git diff - with no parameters check differences between stage area and working directory.
git diff --staged - check differences between stage area and last commit
git diff comit1 comit2 - check differences between two commits
