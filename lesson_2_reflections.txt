I need to initialize a repository for git to know what files should follow.

I think staging area offers me the posibility to make some major change in multiple file and add as only one commit in repository.

Commit stye example: 
http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/

To make sure i use only one commit per logical change, i can veify the changes between actual state of program and stage area (last commit).

git diff - with no parameters check differences between stage area and working directory.
git diff --staged - check differences between stage area and last commit
git diff comit1 comit2 - check differences between two commits 
cat .git/config - shows config file
git branch - shows branch
git branch <name> - create new branch with name = <name>
git checkout <branch_name> - checkout branch

Visualizing branches diagram helps me see the whole changes and evolution of the project and this would probably help me make decisions about the future steps of the project.
